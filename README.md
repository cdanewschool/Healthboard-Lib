HealthBoard - The Shared Library
================================

DESCRIPTION

Funded through the Telemedicine and Advanced Technology Research Center (TATRC) and driven by consultations with the Walter Reed National Military Medical Center (WRNMMC), HealthBoard is a visual dashboard <b>prototype</b> that is designed to improve better patient care through better design. Consisting of two portals—the "<b>Patient Portal</b>" and the "<b>Provider Portal</b>"—HealthBoard is designed to serve both communities through better information.

This repository includes the source for the "<b>Shared Library</b>", which both the <b>Patient Portal</b> and <b>Provider Portal</b> must reference in order for them to run. The <b>Patient Portal</b> and <b>Provider Portal</b> are available separately at https://github.com/piim/TATRAC2-VisualDashboard-Patient and https://github.com/piim/TATRC2-VisualDashboard-Provider respectively.


MORE INFORMATION

The prototype and designs are developed to allow patients (in this case active duty military personnel) the ability to interact with their own personal health information and electronic medical records, and healthcare providers with better access to patients and their decisions. By integrating information design principles HealthBoard provides users with enhanced and streamlined access to information, making it less intimidating and easier to understand the impacts of decisions on health outcomes.

HealthBoard is an Open Source product, designed to enhance and/or complement other existing EMR systems. HealthBoard can be used by EMR developers either completely or in a modular fashion as an enhanced presentation layer (it is currently not connected to any back-end system; all the data displayed is static data read from static XML files). Guidance documents will be included, thereby assisting in the adoption of good design principles by developers easier.
